- Inner join with reviews (target variable)
- Left joins with customers, items, payments
- Aggregation of order-level features
- Geographic feature integration
```

**Anti-Leakage Measures:**
- ‚ùå Exclude review comments and timestamps
- ‚ùå Exclude review creation dates
- ‚úÖ Only use review_score as target
- ‚úÖ All features available at order time

**Master Dataset Result:**
- **99,224 orders** with complete review data
- **50+ base features** from joined tables
- **No target leakage** - all features available at prediction time

---

### **Section 6: Data Preprocessing and Missing Value Handling** üßπ
```python
# Exclusion-Based Preprocessing Strategy
1. Create binary target (review_score >= 4)
2. Drop columns with >95% missing values
3. Remove rows with missing critical values
4. Complete case analysis (exclude any missing)
5. Remove target leakage columns
6. Handle datetime features (extract components)
7. Encode categorical features
```

**Why Exclusion vs Imputation?**
- ‚úÖ Maintains data integrity
- ‚úÖ No artificial patterns introduced
- ‚úÖ Simplifies production deployment
- ‚úÖ Better for business decision-making

**Preprocessing Results:**
- **Original**: 99,224 orders
